  This modifier evaluates a user-defined mathematical expression for every particle 
  and assigns the results to a particle property. It can be used to assign new 
  properties to particles or to modify existing properties.</para>

  <para>
  The math formula specified by the user can depend on existing particle properties or global parameters such as the simulation box size or animation time. 
  The list of available input variables that can be referenced in the formula is displayed in the lower panel.
  </para> 
  
  <simplesect>
    <title>Output property</title>
  
  <para>OVITO differentiates between <emphasis>standard</emphasis> particle properties and <emphasis>custom</emphasis> particle properties.
  The properties of the former type have specific meanings to OVITO (e.g. <literal>Position</literal> or <literal>Particle Identifier</literal>) while custom properties
  have arbitrary, user-defined names (e.g. <literal>MyPropertyA</literal>) and the stored data is not interpreted by OVITO in any way.
  The <emphasis>Compute property</emphasis> modifier allows you to create or modify both types of particle properties. If you use the 
  modifier to assign values to certain standard properties such as <literal>Position</literal>, <literal>Color</literal>, or <literal>Radius</literal>,
  it will immediately affect the visual appearance of particles (see this <link linkend="howto.transparent_particles">example</link>).
  </para>
  
  <para>
  The list of all standard properties known to OVITO can be found in the <emphasis>Output property</emphasis> drop-down list. If you want to create a custom particle property,
  simply enter a name of your choice into the text field. Note that property names in OVITO are case-sensitive.
  </para>

  <simplesect>
    <title>Vector properties</title>
  
  <para>
  Some particle properties (e.g. <literal>Position</literal> or <literal>Color</literal>) are vector quantities, which consist of multiple components per particle. If you want to use the <emphasis>Compute property</emphasis>
  modifier to assign values to such a vector property, then you'll have to enter multiple math expressions, one for each vector component.
  Note that the modifier does not allow you to create custom properties with multiple vector components. 
  </para>
  
  </simplesect>
  
  <simplesect>
    <title>Conditional assignments</title>
  
  <para>
  If the particle property that you are computing already exists, then the existing values will be overwritten with the new ones 
  computed by the modifier. The <emphasis>Compute only for selected particles</emphasis> option, however, makes it possible to restrict the 
  assignment to a subset of particles and preserve the existing property values for unselected particles. 
  If the computed property did not exist before, then unselected particles will be assigned the default value 0 if this option is active.
  </para>
  
  <para>
  Furthermore, the ternary operator <literal>?:</literal> (see table below) allows you to make use of simple <emphasis>if-else</emphasis> conditions. For example, to make all particles
  in the upper half of the simulation box semi-transparent and the particles in the lower half fully opaque, use the following conditional expression to 
  compute the values of the <literal>Transparency</literal> particle property: 
  <programlisting>(ReducedPosition.Z &gt; 0.5) ? 0.7 : 0.0</programlisting>
  </para>
  
  <para>
  For more demanding computation or analysis tasks, which cannot be accomplished with static expressions, please 
  consider using the <link linkend="particles.modifiers.python_script">Python script</link> modifier, 
  which lets you write a modification function in a procedural programming language.

    <title>Including neighbor particles</title>
    <para>By default the property value computed for a particle can only depend on other properties of the same particle (or global quantities).
    The <emphasis>Include neighbor terms</emphasis> options allows to also include nearby particles within a certain cutoff radius
    of the central particle when computing its property value. If this option is active, the final property value <emphasis>P(i)</emphasis> of a central particle <emphasis>i</emphasis> is computed
    as
    <screenshot><mediaobject><imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="images/modifiers/compute_property_modifier_neighbor_formula.png" format="PNG" />
    </imageobject></mediaobject></screenshot>
    The first term, <emphasis>F(i)</emphasis>, is the first user-defined function, which gets evaluated once for the central particle. 
    The second term consists of contributions from all neighbors within the cutoff radius <emphasis>R<subscript>c</subscript></emphasis>. The contributions are given by a second 
    function, <emphasis>G(j)</emphasis>, which is evaluated for every neighbor particle <emphasis>j</emphasis>. The user-defined function <emphasis>G(j)</emphasis>
    is entered into the input field <emphasis>Neighbor expression</emphasis>, and it may only depend on properties
    of the current neighbor, its distance from the central particle, and on global parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
    This allows you to perform advanced computions that take into account the local neighborhood of particles. For example, we can
    average a particle property over a spherical volume around each particle by using the following expressions:
    <programlisting>F(i) := InputProperty / (NumNeighbors+1)
G(j) := InputProperty / (NumNeighbors+1)</programlisting>
    Note that <literal>NumNeighbors</literal> is a dynamic variable, which is queried in this example to normalize the resulting property value.
    We could even weight the contributions from different neighbors based on their distance from the central particle by incorporating the <literal>Distance</literal>
    dynamic variable in the function <emphasis>G(j)</emphasis>. For example, these expressions compute the potential energy according to a Lennard-Jones potential:
    <programlisting>F(i) := 0
G(j) := 4 * (Distance^-12 - Distance^-6)</programlisting>
    Here, no contribution is coming from the central particle.

   similar to the one of the C programming language. Variable names and function names are case-sensitive.

    <title>Example 1</title>
    <para>Our aim is to compute the linear velocity of each
    particle based on the components v<subscript>x</subscript>,
    v<subscript>y</subscript>, and v<subscript>z</subscript> of their velocity
    vectors. For this, we create a new user-defined property with the name "<literal>Speed</literal>". The following
    formula is entered into the expression field: <programlisting>sqrt(Velocity.X^2 + Velocity.Y^2 + Velocity.Z^2)</programlisting>
    Here we reference the X, Y, and Z components of the standard
    <literal>Velocity</literal> particle property, which must be present in the
    input dataset. The computed linear velocity property can 
    subsequently be used, for instance, to color particles with the <emphasis><link
    linkend="particles.modifiers.color_coding">Color Coding</link></emphasis>
    modifier.</para>
  </simplesect>

  <simplesect>
    <title>Example 2</title>
    <para>The <emphasis>Compute property</emphasis> modifier can also be used to set
    particle properties which are not accessible by other means. One such example is
    the per-particle radius: Let us assume we have already selected a subset of particles that 
    we want to give a different size.
    We can use the <emphasis>Compute property</emphasis> modifier to set
    the value of the <literal>Radius</literal> particle property, which determines the
    per-particle display radii. The selection state of particles is given by the
    <literal>Selection</literal> property. With the
    formula <programlisting>Selection ? 1.5 : 1.0</programlisting> we assign a
    radius that depends on the selection state of each particle, which can be either 1 or 0. 
    That is, the above radius expression will evaluate to 1.5 for selected particles, and to 1.0 for unselected
    particles.
