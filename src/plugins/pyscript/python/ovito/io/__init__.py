""" This module contains functions and classes related to file input and output.

It primarily provides two high-level functions for reading and writing
external files:

    * :py:func:`import_file`
    * :py:func:`export_file`

In addition, it contains the :py:class:`FileSource` class, which is a data source object
that reads its input data from an external file.

def import_file(location, **params):
    """ This high-level function imports external data from a file. 
    
        This Python function corresponds to the *Load File* command in OVITO's
        user interface. The format of the imported file is automatically detected.
        However, depending on the file's format, additional keyword parameters may need to be supplied to 
        to specify how the data should be interpreted. These keyword parameters are documented below.
        
        :param str location: The file to import. This can be a local file path or a remote sftp:// URL.
        :returns: The :py:class:`~ovito.ObjectNode` that has been created for the imported data.

        The function creates and returns a new :py:class:`~ovito.ObjectNode`, which provides access the imported data
        or allows you to apply modifiers to it. 
        
        .. note:: 
        
           Note that the newly created :py:class:`~ovito.ObjectNode` is not automatically inserted into the three-dimensional scene. 
           That means it won't appear in the interactive viewports of OVITO or in rendered images.
           However, you can subsequently insert the node into the scene by calling the :py:meth:`~ovito.ObjectNode.add_to_scene` method on it.
        
        Sometimes it may be desirable to reuse an existing :py:class:`~ovito.ObjectNode`. For example if you have already set up a 
        modification pipeline and just want to replace the input data with a different file. In this case you can
        call :py:meth:`node.source.load(...) <ovito.io.FileSource.load>` instead on the existing :py:class:`~ovito.ObjectNode`
        to select another input file while keeping the applied modifiers.
        
        **File columns**
        
        When importing XYZ files or *binary* LAMMPS dump files, the mapping of file columns 
        to OVITO's particle properties must be specified using the ``columns`` keyword parameter::
        
            import_file("file.xyz", columns = 
              ["Particle Identifier", "Particle Type", "Position.X", "Position.Y", "Position.Z"])
        
        The length of the list must match the number of columns in the input file. 
        See the list of :ref:`particle properties <particle-types-list>` for standard property names. You can also specify
        a custom property name, in which case a user-defined particle property with that name is created from the corresponding file column.
        For vector properties, the component must be appended to the property base name as demonstrated for the ``Position`` property in the example above. 
        To skip a file column during import, specify ``None`` instead of a property name at the corresponding position in the columns list.
        
        For *text-based* LAMMPS dump files it is also possible to explicitly specify a file column mapping using the
        ``columns`` keyword. Overriding the default mapping can be useful, for example, if the file columns containing the particle positions
        do not have the standard names ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` (e.g. when reading time-averaged atomic positions computed by LAMMPS). 
        
        **File sequences**
        
        You can import a sequence of files by passing a filename containing a ``*`` wildcard character to :py:func:`!import_file`. There may be 
        only one ``*`` in the filename (and not in a directory name). The wildcard matches only to numbers in a filename.
        
        OVITO scans the directory and imports all matching files that belong to the sequence. Note that OVITO only loads the first file into memory though.
        
        The length of the imported time series is reported by the :py:attr:`~ovito.io.FileSource.num_frames` field of the :py:class:`~ovito.io.FileSource`
        class and is also reflected by the global :py:class:`~ovito.anim.AnimationSettings` object. You can step through the frames of the animation
        sequence as follows:
        
        .. literalinclude:: ../example_snippets/import_access_animation_frames.py
        
        **Multi-timestep files**
        
        Some file formats can store multiple frames in a single file. OVITO cannot know in some cases (e.g. XYZ and LAMMPS dump formats)
        that the file contains multiple frames (because, by default, reading the entire file is avoided for performance reasons). 
        Then it is necessary to explicitly tell OVITO to scan the entire file and load a sequence of frames by supplying the ``multiple_frames`` 
        option:: 
        
            node = import_file("file.dump", multiple_frames = True)
            
        You can then step through the contained frames in the same way as for sequences of files.

        **LAMMPS atom style**
        
        When trying to load a LAMMPS data file which is using an atom style other than "atomic", the atom style must be explicitly
        specified using the ``atom_style`` keyword parameter. The following LAMMPS atom styles are currently supported by
        OVITO: ``angle``, ``atomic``, ``body``, ``bond``, ``charge``, ``dipole``, ``full``, ``molecular``.

                            * ``"imd"`` -- IMD format

        The function evaluates the modification pipeline of the given object node to obtain the data to be exported. 
        This means it is not necessary to call :py:meth:`ObjectNode.compute() <ovito.ObjectNode.compute>` before calling
        :py:func:`!export_file` (but it doesn't hurt either).
        
        Depending on the selected export format, additional keyword arguments must be provided to the function:
       
        **File columns**
        
        When writing files in the *lammps_dump*, *xyz*, or *imd* formats, you must specify the particle properties to be exported 
        using the ``columns`` keyword parameter::
        
            export_file(node, "output.xyz", "xyz", columns = 
              ["Particle Identifier", "Particle Type", "Position.X", "Position.Y", "Position.Z"]
            )
            
        See the list of :ref:`particle properties <particle-types-list>` for valid names. For vector properties, the component must be appended to 
        the property base name as demonstrated for the ``Position`` property in the example above.
        
        **Exporting multiple simulation frames**
        
        By default, only the current animation frame (:py:attr:`~ovito.anim.AnimationSettings.current_frame`) is exported.
        To export a specific frame, pass the ``frame`` keyword parameter to the function.         
        You can export all animation frames by passing ``multiple_frames=True`` to :py:func:`!export_file`. Further
        control is possible using the keyword arguments ``start_frame``, ``end_frame``, and ``every_nth_frame``.
        
        The *lammps_dump* and *xyz* file formats can store multiple frames per file. For all other file formats, or
        if you explicitly want to generate one file per frame, you have to pass wildcard filename to :py:func:`!export_file`.
        This filename must contain exactly one ``*`` character as in the following example. It will be replaced by OVITO with the
        animation frame number::

            export_file(node, "output.*.dump", "lammps_dump", multiple_frames = True)
            
        The above line is equivalent to the following Python loop::
        
            for i in range(node.source.num_frames):
                export_file(node, "output.%i.dump" % i, "lammps_dump", frame = i)
       
        **LAMMPS atom style**
        
        When writing files in the *lammps_data* format, the LAMMPS atom style "atomic" is used by default. If you want to create 
        a data file with a different atom style, it must be explicitly selected using the ``atom_style`` keyword parameter::
        
            export_file(node, "output.data", "lammps_data", atom_tyle = "bond")
        
        The following LAMMPS atom styles are currently supported by OVITO:
        ``angle``, ``atomic``, ``body``, ``bond``, ``charge``, ``dipole``, ``full``, ``molecular``.
        
        **Global attributes**
        
        The *txt* file format allows you to export global quantities computed by OVITO's data pipeline to a text file. 
        For example, to write out the number of FCC atoms identified by the :py:class:`~ovito.modifiers.CommonNeighborAnalysisModifier`
        as a function of simulation time one would do the following::
        
            export_file(node, "data.txt", "txt", 
                columns = ["Timestep", "CommonNeighborAnalysis.counts.FCC"], 
                multiple_frames = True)
            
        See the documentation of an analysis modifier to find out which global quantities it 
        outputs. From a script you can determine which :py:attr:`~ovito.data.DataCollection.attributes` are  available for export as follows::
        
            print(node.compute().attributes)
