/**
 * A cluster transition T_12 is a transformation matrix that connects the
 * reference frames of two clusters 1 and 2.
 * A cluster transition also corresponds to a directed edge in the cluster graph.
 *
 * For every cluster transition T_12 there exists a reverse transition
 * T_21 = (T_12)^-1.
 *
 * If clusters 1 and 2 are adjacent in the input structure, then we can determine
 * the transition matrix T_12 from the neighboring atoms at the common border of the two
 * clusters.
 *
 * Given two cluster transitions T_12 and T_23, we can construct a third
 * cluster transition T_13 = T_23 * T_12, which connects clusters 1 and 3.
 *
 * Every cluster has a so-called self-transition (or identity transition),
 * which is the reverse of itself.

/**
 * A cluster is a connected group of atoms in the input structure that all match
 * one pattern, i.e. they form a contiguous arrangement with long-range order.
 *
 * A cluster constitutes a node in the the so-called cluster graph, which is generated
 * during the pattern matching procedure.
 *
 * Every cluster is associated with an internal frame of reference (which is implicitly defined by the
 * template structure used to create the atomic pattern). When a cluster is created for a group
 * of atoms, an average orientation matrix is calculated that transforms vectors from the cluster's reference frame to the global
 * simulation frame (in a least-square sense).
 *
 * Two clusters that are adjacent in the input structure can have a specific
 * crystallographic orientation relationship, which can be determined from the atoms
 * at their common border. Vectors given in the local coordinate frame of one of the clusters
 * can be transformed to the other cluster's coordinate space. The corresponding transformation
 * matrix is referred to as a 'cluster transition', which constitutes a directed edge in the so-called cluster graph.
